# Testing the Authentication System

## üß™ **Test the Complete Authentication Flow**

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### **2. Test Authentication Flow**

#### **Step 1: Access Authentication Page**
1. Go to [http://localhost:3000/auth](http://localhost:3000/auth)
2. You should see the beautiful authentication page with:
   - Left side: Feature highlights and role explanations
   - Right side: Login form (default)

#### **Step 2: Test Sign Up**
1. Click "Sign up" to switch to the signup form
2. Fill in the form with test data:
   - **Full Name**: Test Administrator
   - **Initials**: TA
   - **Role**: Administrator (to test full access)
   - **Department**: Management
   - **Email**: admin@test.com
   - **Password**: test123456
   - **Confirm Password**: test123456
3. Click "Create account"
4. Check your email for confirmation (or check Supabase dashboard)

#### **Step 3: Test Sign In**
1. Switch back to login form
2. Use the credentials you just created
3. You should be redirected to the dashboard

#### **Step 4: Verify Dashboard Access**
1. You should see the dashboard with your user info in the header
2. Check that your role badge shows "Administrator" with a crown icon
3. Verify your department is displayed

### **3. Test Role-Based Access**

#### **Create Different User Roles**
1. Sign out
2. Create additional test users with different roles:
   - **Manager**: manager@test.com (role: manager)
   - **Viewer**: viewer@test.com (role: viewer)

#### **Test Role Restrictions**
1. **Administrator**: Should see all menu items including "System Settings" and "User Management"
2. **Manager**: Should see "Team Settings" but not user management
3. **Viewer**: Should see basic user info only

### **4. Test Permission-Based Features**

#### **Task Creation**
- **Administrator/Manager**: Should be able to create tasks
- **Viewer**: Should NOT see add task button or be able to create tasks

#### **Task Editing**
- **Administrator/Manager**: Should be able to edit tasks
- **Viewer**: Should see tasks but not edit buttons

#### **Comments**
- **Administrator/Manager**: Should be able to add/edit comments
- **Viewer**: Should see comments but not add new ones

### **5. Test Security Features**

#### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
1. Try to access data through different user accounts
2. Verify that users can only see data they have permission for
3. Check that role-based restrictions are enforced

#### **Authentication State**
1. Refresh the page - user should remain logged in
2. Sign out - should redirect to auth page
3. Try to access dashboard without auth - should redirect to auth page

### **6. Test Error Handling**

#### **Invalid Credentials**
1. Try logging in with wrong password
2. Verify error message is displayed

#### **Permission Denied**
1. Try to access admin features as a viewer
2. Verify access denied message is shown

### **7. Database Verification**

#### **Check Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Check **Table Editor** ‚Üí **users** table
3. Verify new users are created with correct roles
4. Check **permissions** table has all role permissions

#### **Check RLS Policies**
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
3. Check that policies are working correctly

## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"User not found" error**
- Check that the user profile was created in the `users` table
- Verify the migration ran successfully

### **"Permission denied" errors**
- Check that the permissions table has the correct data
- Verify RLS policies are properly configured

### **Authentication not persisting**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase environment variables are correct

### **Role not displaying correctly**
- Check that the user's role was saved correctly
- Verify the role enum values match the frontend

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

Your authentication system is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ Users can sign up with different roles
2. ‚úÖ Users can sign in and stay authenticated
3. ‚úÖ Role badges display correctly in the header
4. ‚úÖ Role-based menu items appear/disappear appropriately
5. ‚úÖ Permission-based features work correctly
6. ‚úÖ RLS policies enforce access control
7. ‚úÖ Users are redirected appropriately based on auth state
8. ‚úÖ Error handling works for invalid credentials
9. ‚úÖ Access denied messages show for insufficient permissions

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

Once authentication is working:

1. **Integrate with existing components** - Update task creation/editing to use permissions
2. **Add user management** - Create admin interface for managing users
3. **Implement audit logging** - Track user actions for compliance
4. **Add password reset** - Implement forgot password functionality
5. **Add email verification** - Require email confirmation for new accounts
6. **Add session management** - Handle multiple device logins
7. **Add 2FA** - Implement two-factor authentication for admin users

## üîê **Security Notes**

- All user passwords are hashed by Supabase Auth
- RLS policies enforce database-level security
- Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized access
- Session tokens are managed securely by Supabase
- No sensitive data is stored in client-side state
